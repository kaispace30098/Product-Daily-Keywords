Generate a word cloud for a product from daily related tweets

Tweepy is a module specially used to handle Twitter API in Python. This project uses tweepy to capture tweets related to user input strings. After preprocessing, including merging sentences, removing punctuation, converting lowercase, tokenizing, removing stop words with input texts, lemmatizing, we present high-frequency words in a word cloud to help marketing departments grasp product trends.
